## Local Launch

> **Note: Because a large number of packages need to be downloaded during the compilation process, and some packages need to access GitHub to download the source code, please keep GitHub accessible. Many 404 Not Found problems are caused by network access failures.**   
> China mainland users who cannot install dependencies properly due to network problems can switch to the `main-cn` branch first: `git checkout main-cn`, or refer to the appendix at the end of the article to configure the npm image.
