With the support of a powerful extension system and complete implementation of LSP, DAP, and Testing protocols, OpenSumi can also develop Java projects, such as Spring Boot or SOFA. It can use the Maven build tool to compile and run projects, and supports the full development, debugging, and testing of Java projects.

To use Java projects, you need to install the following extensions, which can be searched, installed, and downloaded directly from the extension marketplace:

```bash
Language Support for Java: 1.4.0 版本
Debugger for Java: 0.38.0 版本
Test runner for Java: 0.34.1 版本
```

After installing these three extensions, Java project development can begin.

If it is a Maven project, you can install this extension:

```bash
Maven for Java: 0.35.1 版本
```

Then you can use Maven commands for compilation and packaging in the view below the resource manager panel on the left.
