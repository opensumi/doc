The complete extension includes `VS Code extension`, `OpenSumi extension`, and `package.json` contribution points. For different environments and extension functions, the internationalization implementation is compatible with the VS Code extension and also has a certain degree of Scalability.

## VS Code

OpenSumi is compatible with some language pack extensions officially provided by VS Code (it is recommended to use OpenSumi versions above 2.23.6), such as:

- [Chinese (Simplified) (Simplified Chinese) Language Pack for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-CEINTL.vscode-language-pack-zh-hans)
  -...

Currently only supports `zh-cn` and `en-us` two language switching capabilities, if you have further needs, you can submit adaptation requirements at [issues](https://github.com/opensumi/core/issues) .

The VS Code extension abandoned the original `i18n` scheme after version 1.74. It is recommended to use the new `l10n` in the extension as an alternative. If you encounter text that cannot be normally internationalized, you can check the extension version and consider using An older extension version.

At present, OpenSumi does not support localization extensions implemented through `vscode.l10n`. If you encounter related problems, you can leave a message at [#2341](https://github.com/opensumi/core/issues/2341) or + 1. We will further speed up the adaptation process.

## Declaration in PackageJSON

The extension `package.json` supports some purely static contribution points such as Menu and Command. The text in these contribution points can use the placeholder of `%{section}%` to declare the fields of the internationalized text, such as registration one command:

```ts
{
  "contributes": {
    "commands": [
      {
        "command": "Hello OpenSumi",
        "title": "%test-extension-hello-command%"
      }
    ]
  },
}
```

Add a new file named `package.nls.json` in the extension as the default English language package

```json
{
  "test-extension-hello-command": "Test i18n for command"
}
```

For Chinese, it needs to be written in `package.nls.zh-cn.json`, such as:

```json
{
  "test-extension-hello-command": "Test command internationalization"
}
```

Similarly, any contribution point that can display copywriting in the IDE interface contributed by the extension can register the language pack in this way, for example, it can be used in `configurations` like this:

```json
{
  ...
  "configuration": {
    "title": "%test-extension-config-title%",
    "properties": {
      "my-extension.enable-auto-bugfix-feature": {
        "type": "boolean",
        "default": false,
        "description": "%test-extension-config.config.enable-feature%"
      }
    }
  }
  ...
}
```

The extension contribution point will register a configuration item to the framework settings page, which is also declared in `package.nls.json` and `package.nls.zh-cn.json`

```json
{
  "test-extension-config-title": "Test Extension Configuration",
  "test-extension-config.config.enable-feature": "Test enable feature"
}
```

The effect is as follows:

## Node layer uses

Refer to [VS Code i18n Sample](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/tree/afa438d9303c283b29c35d7be1969b952fe06b21/i18n-sample), you need to follow the structure of `i18n/{language}` in the internationalization language pack written in the extension. If your extension source code file `src/utils.ts` needs internationalization support, you should write the language copy in `i18n/out/utils.i18n.json`, and write OpenSumi extension Node code in the same way.

The above examples are applicable to pure VS Code extensions built with `gulpfile.js`, some new version extensions may not be applicable.

For extension projects initialized with OpenSumi CLI, the latest version of `vscode-nls` needs to be installed in the extension before use. The sample code is as follows:

```ts
// extension.ts or extend/node/index.ts
import * as nls from 'vscode-nls';
import * as vscode from 'vscode';

const localize = nls.config({
  messageFormat: nls.MessageFormat.bundle,
  bundleFormat: nls.BundleFormat.standalone
})();

function activate() {
  vscode.window.shoeInfomationMessage(localize('i18n.key', 'defaulMessage'));
}

// others
import * as nls from 'vscode-nls';

const localize = nls.loadMessageBundle();

//...
```

Different from the VS Code, the parameters of `nls.config` have some differences in writing:

```ts
// when using gulp + tsc
const localize = nls.config({ messageFormat: nls.MessageFormat.file });

// when using OpenSumi CLI / webpack
const localize = nls.config({
  messageFormat: nls.MessageFormat.bundle,
  bundleFormat: nls.BundleFormat.standalone
})();
```

Different parameters correspond to how the vscode-nls module will load the language pack file at runtime.

- If it is a pure VS Code extension, use `gulp + tsc` to build the extension, then the language pack of the corresponding file will be loaded through the `i18n` directory structure at runtime, and only `nls.metadata.json` and `nls.metadata will be generated during construction .header.json` is used to record the corresponding language file.
- If you use the OpenSumi extension Node side, or use the VS Code extension packaged by Webpack to compress the extension into a single file, the runtime will try to load the `nls.bundle.{language}.json` file in the `i18n` directory.

At the same time, according to the VS Code extension example, if the language directory corresponding to `i18n` contains `package.nls.json` (such as `i18n/zh-cn/package.nls.json`), when using the `sumi compile/watch` command It will also be extracted into the extension root directory and renamed to `package.nls.{language}.json`.

Whether it is a VS Code extension or an OpenSumi extension, when running `sumi compile` or `sumi watch`, the corresponding language will be extracted to the `out/` directory at the same time.

```

## Browser usage

In the Browse, text can also be declared in `package.nls.json`, but it needs to be imported from the `sumi-browser` module when using the `localize` method. The first parameter represents the copywriting id, which is declared in `package. The field name in nls.json`, the second parameter is the default value when the corresponding language pack copy cannot be found.

```ts
import { localize } from 'sumi-browser';

export const MyPanel = () => {
  return <div>{localize('test-extension-view-title', 'Test Title')}</div>;
};
```

The definition in `package.nls.json` is as follows:

```json
{
  "test-extension-view-title": "Test Title"
}
```
